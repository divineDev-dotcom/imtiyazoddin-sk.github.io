<h2>experience: </h2>
<ul>
<li>Text-to-Speech Application (Project): </li>
<p>Overcoming the challenges of being visually impaired, I designed and developed a text-to-speech application using C++. This project was especially important to me, as it not only showcased my technical expertise but also addressed a personal challenge. This application enables visually impaired individuals, like myself, to have greater access to information by converting text into speech, making it easier for us to comprehend and engage with content. </p>
<li>XSS Payloads Generator (Project): </li>
<p>I developed an XSS payloads generator tool as part of a project, which was crucial in identifying vulnerabilities in web applications. This project was significant because it allowed me to use my knowledge and skills in cybersecurity to create a tool that can help secure web applications against attacks. As someone who is visually impaired, I am passionate about creating solutions that can make technology more accessible and secure for everyone, and this project is an excellent example of that passion. </p>
<li><a href="https://www.videvelopers.com/">V.I. Developers</a> (Software Developer): </li>
<p>As a software developer at V.I. Developers, a non-profit organization focused on the welfare of the visually impaired community, I had the privilege of working on the Tech-Freedom project. This project aimed to create cutting-edge technological tools that empower the visually impaired community. My responsibilities included contributing to the development and maintenance of the Android app, as well as working in the research and development and communication departments. </p>
<p>One of the key projects I worked on was <a href="https://techfreedom.in/">Tech-Freedom</a> for Visually Impaired, an Android app that offers a range of features designed to make life easier for the visually impaired. These features include text-to-speech and speech-to-text capabilities, magnification tools, and voice-guided navigation. As a visually impaired individual, I developed a feature called Voicify TTS, which leverages deep learning techniques to provide more natural and expressive speech output. It was an honor to be a part of this project, which has the potential to make a positive impact on the lives of many people. </p>
<li><a href="https://www.freelancer.com/">FREELANCE</a> WEB DEVELOPER:<a href="https://www.upwork.com/"></a> </li>
<p>As a freelance web developer, I have designed and developed a diverse range of websites for clients. One project I worked on involved creating a responsive e-commerce website for a small business using the Shopify platform. I collaborated closely with the client to understand their branding and design preferences and created a custom theme that aligned with their vision. I also implemented various features, such as a shopping cart, payment gateway integration, and product search functionality, to provide a seamless shopping experience for customers.</p>
<p>Another project I worked on was creating a blog website for a client using WordPress. I utilized various plugins and customizations to ensure the website had a clean and professional look, with a user-friendly interface and intuitive navigation. Additionally, I implemented search engine optimization (SEO) techniques to ensure the website ranked well on search engines and attracted more traffic.</p>
<p>Despite the challenges I faced due to the varied requirements and preferences of different clients, I was able to deliver high-quality websites within the specified timeframes. I followed a structured development process, starting with gathering requirements, creating wireframes, and designing prototypes before moving on to development and testing. Throughout the process, I maintained open communication with the clients, seeking feedback and making necessary adjustments to ensure their satisfaction with the final product.</p>
<li>PENETRATION TESTER </li>
<p>As a Penetration Tester for a cybersecurity company, I assessed the security of various systems and identified vulnerabilities. By conducting thorough testing and analysis, I was able to provide valuable insights to help the company improve their security measures and protect against potential threats.</p>
<p>Through my work as a Penetration Tester, I gained extensive experience with tools and techniques used in ethical hacking and security testing. I also had the opportunity to work on complex projects, collaborating with other professionals to achieve shared goals.</p>
<p>Some of the challenges I faced as a Penetration Tester included navigating inaccessible user interfaces and dealing with systems that were not designed with accessibility in mind. However, I was able to overcome these challenges through my strong problem-solving skills and determination to succeed.</p>
<p>Overall, my experience as a Penetration Tester has given me a deep understanding of the importance of cybersecurity and the skills needed to protect against cyber threats.</p>
